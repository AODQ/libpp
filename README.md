# libpp
The base library of the polyplex engine. (Heavily WIP)


libpp uses a modified version of [gl3n](https://github.com/Dav1dde/gl3n) made to fit the code-style of libpp. Seen in the `polyplex.math` package.

Notice, the library is written in what would be considered non-idiomatic D. 

A styleguide will be drafted at some point and the code will be cleaned up once it's in a more functional state.
